## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Pavlo-Orhunov

I have been studying ***web page layout*** for a few years. I recently completed a course on the 'Freelancer Life Style' education platform and earned a certificate. I already have completed projects â€” some following lessons from different instructors, and others created independently. You can find all my work here.

I plan to continue growing as a web page ***layout designer*** because I find this field of IT, which I entered not long ago, extremely interesting. I want to keep improving my skills in creating engaging and visually appealing layouts.

Previously, I worked as a software tester on Applause (uTest platform), having previously completed all the academy courses, received a tester certificate, having completed courses in Ukraine.

I also have extensive experience in the financial and banking sector. I also have experience in developing and adjusting contracts and technical documentation for turnkey projects for construction. Managed small teams (up to 10 people). I have extensive experience using various software in everyday work (from simple text editors to specialized accounting programs).
