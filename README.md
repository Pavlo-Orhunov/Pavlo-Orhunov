## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Pavlo-Orhunov

I've been studying the theory and practice of ***web page layout*** for over a year now. Today I already have ready-made works, laid out both according to the lessons of various teachers, and done independently. All results are presented here.

I plan to continue to develop as a web page ***layout designer***, because this area of IT, which I entered not so long ago, is extremely interesting to me and I would like to improve in the layout of interesting and beautiful layouts.

Previously, I worked as a software tester on Applause (uTest platform), having previously completed all the academy courses, having previously received a tester certificate, having completed courses in Ukraine.

I also have extensive experience in the financial and banking sector. We also have experience in developing and adjusting contracts and technical documentation for turnkey construction projects. Management of small teams (up to 10 people). I have extensive experience using various software in everyday work (from simple text editors to specialized accounting programs).
