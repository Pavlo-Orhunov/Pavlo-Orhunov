## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Pavlo-Orhunov
I have been studying software testing for the last few months. Completed courses and received a certificate. I know the theory of testing and have experience with HTML/CSS for creating a [blog](https://razumnaekonomia.blogspot.com/).

I work as a freelancer on the Applause (uTest platform), having previously completed all academy courses. I want to develop in QA because this area of IT, which I only learned about a year ago, is extremely interesting for me and I would like to improve in the field of manual testing as well as automation.

I have vast experience in the financial and banking sector. Also, there is an experience in the development and adjustment of contracts and technical documentation for turnkey construction projects. Managed small teams (up to 10 people). I have extensive experience in using various software in my daily work (from simple text editors to specialized accounting programs).
